        <p>It shouldn't be a surprise that college football's capital landscape has been a rollercoaster since the beginning of the 21st century. Between the transition of the BCS Championship game to the College Football Playoff in 2014 and the recent NIL deal in 2021, the economy surrounding the sport has been on a steady increase. 
          </p>
        <p>In 2005, the total expense of D1 FBS football was roughly $3.4 billion and the total revenue was around $3.5 billion. Since then, there has been a relatively steady increase in both categories,. 2017 to 2020 saw numbers fluctuating between $8 and $9 billion for both expenses and revenue. 2021 did take a small dip with $7.6 billion in expenses and $7.3 billion in revenue. Something that is worth noting is the drastic difference in percentages of where the revenue came from.</p>
        <p> In 2005, a whopping 25% of the revenue was due to ticket sales and 18% was from NCAA and Conference distribution, media rights, and post-season football with $642 million. Donor contributions also was a major source, taking up 21% with $737 million. The statistics look much different in 2021 with only 3% of revenue coming from ticket sales and 37% was due to the NCAA and Conference distribution, media rights, and post-season football with $2,707 million. Donor contributions nearly doubled by 2021 with $1,386 million and another big riser was Institutional and Government support which generated $1,318 million at 18% of revenue. This growth in income shows us that college football is becoming bigger and more important than ever.</p>
        <p>With the largest amounts of money coming from media rights, post-season football, donor contributions, and institutional and government support; and the once revenue-leading ticket sales dropping at a surprising 22% rate, it is clear that the sport has become much more commercialized. Seeing an increase in donor contributions, institutional support, and post-season football is largely due to the popularity of the College Football Playoffs and the increase in competitiveness between Universities to see their football team and conferences represented.

        <p>When it comes to spending in the college football world, every year the percentages of where the money goes are roughly the same, only the total expense cost increases. Athletic student aid, support and administration compensation, facilities and equipment, game expenses and travel, and coaches salaries are where most of the money goes every year. 
         <p>
          <p>
          It is not too surprising that the spending does not change like the income sources do, but according to former Syracuse Football player, Sam Warren, he sees the coach and administration compensation taking up almost half of the money spent as a bit of a shock. In comparison, the money spent on medical expenses is just a 2% sliver which Warren described as concerning. Recruiting is perhaps the most important aspect of college football and although the <a href="https://www.ncsasports.org/name-image-likeness" target="_blank" color=blue>NIL</a> started just after the 2021 season, the money spent on recruiting has still been unusually low. The expense for recruiting did not reach the $100 million until 2014 and increased every year until a dip in 2020 and a major $87 million dollar dip in 2021. Aligning with the common trend of increased money during 2014 with the start of the College Football Playoff, the increased spending on recruiting makes sense. 
        <p>
          <p>
        Warren believes that the NIL is going to be used as a vital tool in recruitment in the future; with high-profile transfer portal players and recruits expecting a big pay day in their pitch to go to a given program. The emergence of the NIL could also be a leading factor for the decrease in spending on recruiting the last couple of years as coaches and schools knew a change was coming. 
        <p>
          <p> In terms of contrast between Conference spending and revenue, Warren noted that the Big 10 and SEC unsurprisingly dominate the rest of the Power 5, especially since they have the best media contracts. The Power 5 Conferences of the SEC, Big 10, ACC, Big 12, and Pac 12 have all increased in capital since 2005; and while the Group of 5 Conferences have increased as well, the numbers are much more staggered. The SEC gained $1.8 billion in total revenue, followed by the Big 10 at $1.2 billion and the ACC at $816 million in 2021. This portrays how certain Conferences rule college football and it doesn't seem like that will change any time soon with big brand names like Texas, Oklahoma, USC, and UCLA joining the SEC and Big 10 in the coming seasons.

              <p>The world of college football is one of the most trending sports in America with the addition of the NIL and the expansion of the College Football Playoff for the 2024 season. The total cost of revenue and spending will surely increase dramatically in the next decade.<p>
